# gnomium-webapps

A set of webapps ran by chromium for gnome desktop environments.

This repository is nothing more and nothing less than a nice set of app-shortcuts that are executed by chromium (or chrome).

## Installation

NOTE: chromium is required in order to run the webapps.

For installation on ubuntu systems, just copy the .desktop file to /usr/share/applications/:

```
  $ sudo cp example.desktop /usr/share/applications/
```

Now the app should be available in the application menu.

For installation of icons, I recommend the [la capitaine icon theme](https://github.com/keeferrourke/la-capitaine-icon-theme) by [keeferrourke](https://github.com/keeferrourke/) as it covers a lot of standard-applications.
